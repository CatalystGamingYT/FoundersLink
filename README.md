# FoundersLink ‚Äì The Social Network for Verified Business Owners

## üß† Project Description

**FoundersLink** is an Android web app that connects verified business owners through a professional, social media‚Äìstyle platform. Inspired by the visual layout of Instagram and the flexible post types of Twitter, the app creates a trusted space where LLC, S-Corp, C-Corp, and sole proprietors can network, share content, and collaborate.

Unlike general-purpose platforms like LinkedIn or Facebook, FoundersLink is exclusively for real, active entrepreneurs‚Äîverified via EIN or business documentation. It is designed to solve the problem of noise, spam, and low-quality networking in existing online communities by creating a space where only true business builders can engage.
